    1. Spin up a Node.js-driven Server (on port 3000).
    2. Handle two Routes "/" and "/users".
        - Return some greeting text on "/"
        - Return a list of dummy users.

    3. Add a form with a "username" <input> to the "/" page and submit a POST request to "/create-user" upon a button click.
    4. Add the "/create-user" route and parse this incoming data(i.e. the username) and simply log it to the console.
